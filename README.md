Welcome to the official documentation for **cellink**â€”the toolkit designed to bridge the gap between single-cell data and individual-level genetic analysis.

## Motivation

Integrating genetic data with cellular heterogeneity is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. **cellink** provides the missing framework for efficiently handling and analyzing genetic variation alongside complex single-cell omics data at scale.

## âœ¨ Key Features & Structure

**cellink** introduces the `DonorData` class, unifying individual-level and single-cell data. It extends standard formats (AnnData, MuData) with GenoAnnData for efficient genotype (via dask) and phenotype (via ehrapy) handling.

- **Donor-level Data (G):** `GenoAnnData`, Stores individual level data such as genotypes.
- **Cell-level Data (C):** `AnnData`/ `MuData`, Stores single-cell omics data such as gene expression.

Crucially, **`DonorData`** ensures that genetic data and single-cell modalities remain **synchronized**, preserving their donor-cell pairing even through complex filtering operations (e.g., selecting specific cell types or patient subsets).

### 2. Comprehensive Toolkit

**cellink** offers a streamlined suite of tools for the entire analysis workflow:

- **[Variant Preprocessing & Annotation](https://cellink-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/explore_annotations.html):** Tools for quality control, annotation (VCF export/import), and selection of genetic variants.
- **Specialized Downstream Analysis:** Easily perform complex genetic analyses on single-cell expression data, including:
    - [eQTL mapping](https://cellink-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/pseudobulk_eqtl.html).
          <!-- * Colocalization analysis with established disease loci. -->
    - [Rare variant association studies]([tutorials/burden_testing.ipynb](https://cellink-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/burden_testing.html)).
- **Interoperability:** **cellink** enhances standard workflows through data exports compatible with common genetic analysis tools, e.g., for [eQTL analysis with jaxqtl or tensorqtl](https://cellink-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/pseudobulk_eqtl_jaxqtl_tensorqtl.html) and includes built-in [dataloaders for deep learning](https://cellink-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/run_dataloader.html).
