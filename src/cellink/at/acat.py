    """
    Perform the Aggregated Cauchy Association Test (ACAT) to combine p-values.

    ACAT is a fast and robust method for combining possibly dependent p-values,
    using properties of the Cauchy distribution. It is especially effective when
    only a subset of the input p-values are small.
    Inspired by: https://github.com/yaowuliu/ACAT/blob/master/R/ACAT.R

    Parameters
    ----------
    pvalues : np.ndarray or list of float
        The p-values to combine. Must be in the range [0, 1]. NaN values are ignored.

    tolerance : float, optional
        A lower bound for p-values to ensure numerical stability. Values below this threshold
        are clipped to `tolerance`. Default is 1e-16.

    weights : np.ndarray or list of float, optional
        Non-negative weights for each p-value. If None, equal weights are used.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The ACAT-combined p-value.

def compute_acat(pvs: np.ndarray, tolerance: float = 1e-16, weights: np.ndarray = None) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Aggregate p-values using the Cauchy combination method (ACAT).

    This function performs p-value aggregation using the ACAT (Aggregated Cauchy Association Test) method,
    which is particularly powerful and robust for combining dependent and sparse p-values. It supports
    missing values (NaNs) and optional weighting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pvs : np.ndarray
        A 2D array of shape (n_different_tests, n_tests_to_integrate), where each row contains
        the p-values to be aggregated into a single meta p-value. Values must be in the range [0, 1].
        NaNs are allowed and will be ignored during aggregation.

    tolerance : float, optional
        A small threshold to avoid issues with extremely small p-values. Values below `tolerance`
        are capped at `tolerance` to maintain numerical stability. Default is 1e-16.

    weights : np.ndarray, optional
        A 1D array of non-negative weights with shape (n_tests_to_integrate,). If provided,
        it should sum to 1 or will be internally normalized. If None, equal weights are used.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        A 1D array of aggregated p-values, one for each row of the input `pvs`.

    Notes
    -----
    The ACAT method transforms each p-value `p` using the tangent function:
        T = sum_i w_i * tan[(0.5 - p_i) * pi]
    Then the aggregated p-value is computed using the Cauchy distribution:
        p_combined = 0.5 - arctan(T) / pi
